# Face Detection (Phase 1)
Face detection is performed by using classifiers. A classifier is essentially an algorithm that decides whether a given image is face (positive) or not a face(negative). A classifier needs to be trained on thousands of images with and without faces. But, OpenCV already has two pre-trained face detection classifiers, which can readily be used in a program. The two classifiers are: Haar Classifier and Local Binary Pattern(LBP) classifier. 
Here, We are using the Haar classifier.

Haar cascade files
OpenCV comes with a lot of pre-trained classifiers. For instance, there are classifiers for smile, eyes, face, etc. These come in the form of XML files and are located in the folder opencv/data/haarcascades/.
Download the XML files and place them in the data folder in the same working directory as the spyder notebook.
